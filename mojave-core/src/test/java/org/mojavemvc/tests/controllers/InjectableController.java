/**
 * This class demonstrates the basic pattern for injecting a controller into
 * other controllers:
 * <p>
 * 1. give the controller an interface that exposes the public methods of
 * interest
 * <p>
 * 2. in the application's Guice module, bind the interface to the controller
 * implementation
 * <p>
 * 3. inject the controller interface into other conrollers
 * <p>
 * Controllers that are to be injected into other controllers don't have to
 * implement an interface, but this is a best practice, as it facilitates
 * testing, and decouples objects.

/**
 * <p>
 * A controller annotated with this annotation is flagged as the default
 * controller for all application requests not specifying a controller. Only one
 * controller in the application can be annotated with this annotation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As an example, consider the following controller:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;DefaultController
 * &#064;StatelessController(&quot;test&quot;)
 * public class SomeController {
 * 
 *     &#064;Action(&quot;some-action&quot;)
 *     public View someAction() {
 *         return new View(&quot;test.jsp&quot;);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * We can invoke the "some-action" method by making the following request:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * http://...?actn=some-action
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since there was no controller variable supplied, the default controller was
 * used as the controller for the request.
 * </p>

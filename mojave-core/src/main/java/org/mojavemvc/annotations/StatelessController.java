/**
 * <p>
 * A new instance of this controller is created per request. Its 
 * dependencies are injected after creation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following are valid declarations of stateless controllers:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;StatelessController
 * public class SomeController {
 *  ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;StatelessController("some-name")
 * public class SomeController {
 *  ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: As a new instance of a stateless controller is created with every request, 
 * the developer should not design the stateless controller with state. That 
 * is, class fields should not be used with the intention of storing state between 
 * requests, but they can be used for storing state in the object during a request. 
 * For storing state between requests, use a {@link StatefulController}.

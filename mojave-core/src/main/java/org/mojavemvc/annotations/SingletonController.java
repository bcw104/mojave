/**
 * <p>
 * Only one instance of this controller will exist in the application, placed in
 * the front controller context. Its dependencies, if any, are re-injected with
 * every new request.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following are valid declarations of singleton controllers:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SingletonController
 * public class SomeController {
 *  ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SingletonController("some-name")
 * public class SomeController {
 *  ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: It is up to the developer to address thread-safety in singleton
 * controllers. The single instance will be accessed simultaneously by multiple
 * threads, and thus there will be concurrency issues to address. The container
 * will not attempt to address those issues.

/**
 * <p>
 * Supplied as an optional parameter to &#064;BeforeAction and &#064;AfterAction
 * methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class can be made available to intercepting action 
 * methods, simply by writing the method signature with it as a parameter.
 * It contains a reference to the servlet request and response objects, as
 * well as to the Java parameters sent in the request, and to the String
 * names of the action and controller being invoked in this request.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, the following method demonstrates its usage:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;BeforeAction
 * public void doSomethingBefore( RequestContext ctx ) {
 *  //do something
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Developers should note that while all the fields are declared final,
 * the class is not completely immutable, as it exports state through
 * the request, response, and paramters objects. When an accessor is
 * called for one of these fields, a reference to the actual object, 
 * not to a copy, is returned.
 * </p>
